# PYTHON MODULE - 2
# (A) Built-in Functions -Binary Conversion Using Built-in Functions in Python

## ðŸŽ¯ Aim:
To write a Python program to convert the number **16** into its **binary representation** using built-in Python functions.

## ðŸ§  Algorithm:
1. Assign the value `16` to a variable `a`.
2. Use the built-in `bin()` function to convert the number to binary.
3. Print the result.

## ðŸ§¾ Program:

a = 16 # assigning 16 to a

b = bin(a) # converting decimal number to binary number using bin() built-in-function

print(b) # to print b

## Output:

## Result:
Thus, The Python program to convert the number **16** into its **binary representation** using built-in Python functions is verified.
